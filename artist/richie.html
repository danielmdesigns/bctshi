        <p>Richie was born and raised here in Hawaii and started drawing as a kid, but never stopped. He started tattooing in 2003 and studies every style of tattooing and is quite versatile.</p>
 
<p>Richie also is a fine artist able to work in almost every medium he can get his hands on, including oils, pastels, airbrushing, and watercolor. He enjoys Asian influenced art and realism for tattooing but is open to any style and artistic idea.</p>
 
<p>He also is able to draw anything on the spot and he is well known to freehand any any and every idea for tattooing from full Japanese inspired sleeves and backpieces to soft black and grey portraits and even complex color designs.</p>
 
<p>He believes that drawing it himself on the skin is the best way to give his clients not only a fully custom and unique tattoo that will fit the body perfectly, but also a piece of art that he can put his heart and passion in.</p>
