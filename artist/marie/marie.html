        <p>As an artist, I have a deep appreciation for color and space. I have always admired Alphonse Mucha as well as other decorative and ornamental artists as this style lends itself well to tattooing. I have a broad appreciation for the classical artists, such as Klimt, Renoir, Monet, Bernini, DaVinci, Gauguin, Matisse, Botticelli, Artemesia Gentileschi, and more. I studied fashion design at Philadelphia University and realized I had a strong dislike for the, "industry." I then attended Temple University to study art history, which was informative but I was young and wanted to travel.</p>
 
<p>I am especially fond of Japanese tattoos and have always been drawn to Asian aesthetics in general. I grew up with Polish/Irish parents in a Roman-Catholic household in a small beach town and had no Asian sources in my everyday life to draw upon until I moved to Oahu almost 10 years ago. I suppose the prevalence of Victorian influence in my hometown contributed to my obsession with ornamental design, flowing patterns, and color.</p>
 
<p>I moved to Hawaii almost 10 years ago for no reason other than I was on a traveling kick and had not planned to stay. I loved the life I had adopted however on the North Shore of surfing and appreciating the ocean and the general laid back lifestyle. Since tattooing has become one of the biggest parts of my life, I hope to use my work as a way to continue the traveling I had started a long time ago and draw upon other cultures and lifestyles as inspiration for my tattoos and artwork.</p>
